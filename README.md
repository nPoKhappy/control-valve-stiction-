# control-valve-stiction-
This is my undergraduate project for non-invasive control valve stiction qutification implementation.

First thesis implementation is based on S. K. Damarla, X. Sun, F. Xu, A. Shah, and B. Huang, "Statistical test-based practical methods for detection and quantification of stiction in control valves," Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, vol. 62, no. 12, pp. xxx-xxx, 2023. 
Four statistical method involved in it.

Second theis implementation is based on S. K. Damarla, X. Sun, F. Xu, A. Shah and B. Huang, "A Sigmoid Function based Method for Detection of Stiction in Control Valves," 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Advanced Control of Industrial Processes (AdCONIP), Vancouver, BC, Canada, 2022, pp. 210-215.
fitting a s-shape like function to control valve phase plot.

Third theis implementation is based on S. K. Damarla, X. Sun, F. Xu, A. Shah, J. Amalraj, and B. Huang, "Practical linear regression-based method for detection and quantification of stiction in control valves," Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,Jan. 2022, vol. 61, no. 1, pp. 502–514.
using linear regression to get slope to quantify.
